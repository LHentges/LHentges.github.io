<h2>Principle component analysis - PCA</h2>

<p>
   PCA is a unsupervised machine learning technique
</p>
<p>
  A very common use for PCA is dimensionality reduction - particularly if a dataset contains many features
 (e.g. a row in a dataset has many columns of variables). This works by linearly transforming the features such that 
   <a href = "stats.html" target = "_self">covariance</a> is maximized.
