<h5>Principle component analysis - PCA</h5>

<p>
   PCA is a unsupervised machine learning technique
</p>
<p>
  A very common use for PCA is dimensionality reduction - particularly if a dataset contains many features
 (e.g. a row in a dataset has many columns of variables). This works by linearly transforming the features such that covariance 
   is maximized.
