<h2>Principle component analysis - PCA</h2>

<p>
   PCA is a unsupervised machine learning technique
</p>
<p>
   A very common use for PCA is dimensionality reduction - particularly if a dataset contains many features 
   (e.g. a row in a dataset has many columns of variables). This works by linearly transforming the features such that 
   <a href = "stats.html" target = "_self">covariance</a> is maximized.
</p>
<p>
   It is also possible to use PCA for clustering purposes while mantaining the same number of dimensions (usually 
   dimensionality reduction is also done in these cases; it is not possible to linearly transform to a larger number of 
   dimensions). The most simple scenerio, and also the easiest way to picture what is happening, is to consider a 2-D scatter 
   plot which gets linearly transformed (a very good video resource explaining how linear transformation can be thought of as 
   a change in the organization of space <a href = "https://youtu.be/kYB8IZa5AuE" target = "_self">covariance</a>). The data
   could be represented as a table of x and y coordinates, or as a matrix. Now imagine each "x" value is multiplied by some
   number and each "y" value is multiplied by another number, you can see that this is an isomorphism - that is the same data 
   are being represented in a different way (you can imagine it would be possible to get the original x and y values back if
   you knew the multipliers, though this is not possible when the dimension has been reduced).
</p>
<p>
   What values should you choose as the multipliers to shift your dataset?
