### Machine learning for the modern lady and gentleman

I want to maintain a space to keep my machine learning documentation, and I think if it's a public directory this infomation may help others learning these concepts. I'm currently a PhD student, and while becoming an expert in machine learning is very much a part of my degree, blogging definitely is not. I've had a fair bit of experience teaching (10+ years as an instructor, TA, tutor, and internal corporate trainer), and I find that I learn much more completely by explaining concepts to others. With this in mind, beyond providing executable code I will offer my explanations of the process (which hopefully are useful), as well as links to key journal articles and resources that helped me.

I intend to take a "middle-out" approach to concepts. That is start with a topic of interest (e.g. deep learning and convolution), explain the fundamentals and how it's used, <em>then</em> expand outward. For people solely interested in building a tool, this should be adequate. For those interested in knowing a topic more completely, I'll delve deeper into why a system works, as well as exploring new and interesting ways the concept is being applied. While it may seem more natural to begin with first principles (start from the beginning right?), in practice I find it's difficult to stay motivated learning rudimentary concepts with only a dim hope of it becoming useful in the future.
