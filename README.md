### Machine learning for the modern lady and gentleman

It's useful for me to maintain a space for my machine learning documentation, and I think by making it a public directory it may helpful for others as well. I'm currently a PhD student, and while becoming an expert in machine learning is very much a part of my degree, blogging is definitely not. I've had a fair bit of experience teaching (combined 10+ years as an instructor, TA, tutor, and internal corporate trainer), and I find that I learn much more completely by explaining concepts to others. With this in mind, beyond providing executable code I will offer my explanations of the process (which are hopefully useful for others), along with links to key journal articles and resources that helped me.

I like to take a "middle-out" approach to concepts. That is I start with a topic of interest (e.g. deep learning and convolution), explore the fundamentals and how it's used, <em>then</em> expand outward. I'll delve deeper into why a system works, as well as exploring new and interesting ways the concept is being applied. While it may seem more natural to begin with first principles (start from the beginning right?), in practice I find it's difficult to stay motivated learning rudimentary concepts with only a dim hope of it becoming useful in the future.

Practicalities: I use python 3.5, keras with tensorflow backend for supervised learning, and scikitlearn for unsupervised learning (to start) - I'll also be building some tools from scratch!

#### Personal

I'm interested in the application of ai in genomics. Currently the focus of this space is on machine learning, but as it develops I hope to include more of this.
