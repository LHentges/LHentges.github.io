<h2>Machine Learning for the modern lady and gentleman</h2>
<h4>About</h4>

<p>
  It's useful for me to maintain a space for my machine learning documentation, and I think by making it 
  a public directory it may helpful for others as well. I'm currently a PhD student, and while becoming an
  expert in machine learning is very much a part of my degree, blogging is definitely not. I've had a fair 
  bit of experience teaching (combined 10+ years as an instructor, TA, tutor, and internal corporate trainer), 
  and I find that I learn much more completely by explaining concepts to others. With this in mind, beyond
  providing executable code I will offer my explanations of the process (which are hopefully useful for others),
  along with links to key journal articles and resources that helped me.

  I like to take a "middle-out" approach to concepts. That is I start with a topic of interest (e.g. 
  deep learning and convolution), explore the fundamentals and how it's used, <em>then</em> expand
  outward. I'll delve deeper into why a system works, as well as exploring new and interesting 
  ways the concept is being applied. While it may seem more natural to begin with first principles 
  (start from the beginning right?), in practice I find it's difficult to stay motivated learning 
  rudimentary concepts with only a dim hope of it becoming useful in the future.

  Practicalities: I use python 3.5, keras with tensorflow backend for supervised learning, and scikitlearn 
  for unsupervised learning (to start) - I'll also be building some tools from scratch!
