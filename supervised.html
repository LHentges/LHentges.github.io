<h2>Supervised Learning</h2>
<p>Machine learning as a term is a bit hard to pin down because it's used in so many different contexts. Generally though, it describes systems which perform mathematical operations on inputed data resulting in an internal organization of said data, which is then used for some user-defined task. With unsupervised learning data are the only information given to the algorithm, while with supervised learning both data and the desired output (or groundtruth) are given; what the machine learns here is the mathematical path between the inputs and the outputs.</p>
