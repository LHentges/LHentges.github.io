<h2>Machine Learning for the modern lady and gentleman</h2>
<h4>AI vs. ML</h4>

<p>So, what's the difference between artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning?
It seems that these terms are used more or less interchangeably, and I guess that's because 
most of the time they can be. AI in many regards is more of a philosophy, and experts in
this field are concerned with simulating "intelligence" outside of non-biological nervous systems.
Of course there are unlimited definitions for intelligence and it's impossible to quantify,
but generally in this context it's measured by comparing an AI system to human performance for some given 
task (most of these tasks can eventually be distilled to pattern recognition).</p>

<p>Machine learning is a term that describes algorithms structured in such a way as to automatically
adjust themselves to their input data. AI utilizes these algorithms to complete given "intelligence" tasks. 
Indeed machine learning is generally considered a subfield of AI, and the two are not easily be separated. 
In fact, one of the most powerful machine learning algorithms - the convolutional neural network (CNN) - is 
based on a mathematical model of a nervous system!</p>

<p>
  And what about deep learning? Well this just refers to the structure of machine learning algorithms having multiple layers.
  One famous machine learning model invented in the infancy of the field was the <a href=perceptron.html>perceptron</a>. 
  While foundational for modern algorithms, the inability of this model to implement some logical functions 
  (notably <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perceptrons_(book)>XOR</a>) and classify non-linerly separatable inputs 
  greatly contributed to the AI winter. Importantly, these problems can be solved by adding additional "hidden" 
  layers between the input and output layers. Nowadays algorithms tasked with identifying complex, abstract patterns are
  often many layers "deep".
