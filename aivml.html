<h2>Machine Learning for the modern lady and gentleman</h2>
<h4>AI vs. ML</h4>

<p>So, what's the difference between artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning?
It seems that these terms are used more or less interchangeably, and I guess that's because 
most of the time they can be. AI in many regards is more of a philosophy, and experts in
this field are concerned with simulating "intelligence" outside of non-biological nervous systems.
Of course there are unlimited definitions for intelligence and it's impossible to quantify,
but generally in this context it's measured by comparing an AI system to human performance for some given 
task (most of these tasks can eventually be distilled to pattern recognition).</p>

<p>Machine learning is a term that describes algorithms structured in such a way as to automatically
adjust themselves to their input data. AI utilizes these algorithms to complete given "intelligence" tasks. 
Indeed machine learning is generally considered a subfield of AI, and the two cannot easily be separated. 
In fact, one of the most powerful machine learning algorithms - the convolutional neural network (CNN) - is 
based on a mathematical model of a nervous system!</p>
