It seems that these terms are used more or less interchangeably, and I guess that's because 
most of the time they can be. AI in many regards is more of a philosophy, and experts in
this field are concerned with simulating "intelligence" outside of non-biological nervous systems.
Of course there are unlimited definitions for intelligence and it's impossible to quantify,
but generally in this context it's measured by comparing an AI system to human performance for some given 
task (most of these tasks can eventually be distilled to pattern recognition).

Machine learning is a term that describes algorithms which are structured in such a way to automatically adjust to
